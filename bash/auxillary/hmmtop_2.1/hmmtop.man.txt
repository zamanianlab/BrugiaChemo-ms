NAME
       HMMTOP  - Prediction of transmembrane helices and topology
       for transmembrane proteins using hidden Markov model

COMMAND
       hmmtop   -if=name   [-of=name]   [-sf=format]   [-lf=name]
       [-pi=mode]  [-ps=size]  [-is=point]  [-in=num] [-pp] [-pc]

DESCRIPTION
       hmmtop predicts membrane  topology  of  integral  membrane
       proteins using hidden Markov model. The program can inter-
       pret multiple sequences in two different  ways.  In  mpred
       mode  prediction  will  be provided for the first sequence
       interpreting further sequences as homologues to the  first
       one.   The  homologous  sequences  provided  need  not  be
       aligned. In spred mode hmmtop simply evaluates  the  input
       sequences one by one, providing independent prediction for
       each of them using only single sequence information.
       hmmtop can read from the standard input. It supports three
       input  sequence  formats  (FASTA, NBRF/PIR, SWISSPROT) and
       offers various output formats. The options are case sensi-
       tive,  but  their values are case insensitive (for example
       -sf=pir is  the  same  as  -sf=PIR,  but  -SF=PIR  is  not
       accepted).   The option name, the equal sign and its value
       have to be written in one word  (for  example  -sf=pir  is
       accepted,  but  -sf=  pir,  -sf  =pir  or -sf = pir is not
       interpreted).
       The architecture of the hidden Markov model has to defined
       in  a  file  (called hmmtop.arch by thedault) and the HMM-
       TOP_ARCH environment variable has to point this  architec-
       ture file. The program uses a pseudo count method in order
       to faster optimization. The data of the pseudo count  vec-
       tor  are  given in the hmmtop.psv file, and the HMMTOP_PSV
       environment variable has to point this file.


INPUT OPTIONS
       -if=name, --input_file=name
              name of the input sequence file. If name is -- then
              the program reads from the standard input.


       -sf=format, --sequence_format=format
              format  of  the  sequence(s). format may be FAS for
              fasta format (default), PIR for NBRF/PIR format  or
              SWP for  SWISSPROT format.


       -pi=mode, --process_inputfile=mode
              treat  sequences in input file as single or homolo-
              gous sequences. mode may be spred or mpred.  In the
              case  of  spred  prediction  will  be done for each
              sequence in the input_file (default). In  the  case
              of mpred prediction will be done only for the first
              sequence  in  the  input  file  and  the  remaining
              sequences will be treated as helpers.


       -ps=size, --pseudo_size=size
              size  of the pseudo count vector.  size may be from
              0  (no  pseudo  count   vector   used)   to   10000
              (default=10000).


       -is=point, --iteration_start=point
              starting  point of the iteration(s).  point  may be
              pseudo or random.  In the case of pseudo the itera-
              tion starts from the pseudo countvector  (default).
              In  the case  of random the iteration  starts  from
              random values.


       -in=num, --iteration_number=num
              num  is  the  number of iterations (only if the -is
              flag is random).


       -loc=b-e-sp, --locate=b-e-sp
              locates or locks a given sequence piece in a  given
              structural part. The sequence piece is given by b-e
              numbers, where b is the begin position,  e  is  the
              end position.  sp is the structural part and sp may
              be i, I, o, O and H for inside tail,  inside  loop,
              outside tail, outside loop and helix parts, respec-
              tively. e position may be the character  E  meaning
              the C terminal end of the sequence.


       -locf=file_name, --loc_file=file_name
              file  for  multiple  locates. If the input sequence
              file  contains  multiple  sequences  and  -pi=spred
              option is given, then for each sequence the program
              reads the locates from  the  file_name  given.  The
              locates  have to be line by line for each sequence,
              and the syntaxis is  the  same  as  in  -loc=b-e-sp
              option (see above).


       -noit, --noiteration
              makes  prediction  without any iteration (optimiza-
              tion), i.e. the parameters  of  the  hidden  Markov
              model  are  set  to the pseudo count vector, and no
              iteration will be done to maximize the  probability
              if the model is given. Therefore, this option makes
              the program behaviour similar to MEMSAT and  TMHMM,
              i.e. it is more faster but less reliable.


OUTPUT OPTIONS
       In  the output hmmtop prints the number of amino acids and
       the name of the predicted sequence in  one  line  begining
       with  a  '>HP: ' string, and following by the localization
       of the N terminal amino acid (IN or OUT),  the  number  of
       the  predicted transmembrane helices and the begin and end
       positions of each transmembrane helix.  Additional  output
       can be generated by the following options.


       -of=name, --output_file=name
              name of the output sequence file. If this option is
              omitted or name is -- then the  program  writes  to
              the standard output.


       -pp, --print_probabilities
              Print the optimized probabilities.


       -pc, --print_pseudocount
              Print the pseudocount vector used.


       -pl, --print_longprediction
              Print  prediction  in  a  long  format.  The  input
              sequence and the  predicted  localization  of  each
              amino acid will be printed.



MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a long help message.


       -sh, --short_help
              Print a short help message.


       -lf=name, --log_file=name
              name of the log file for debugging purposes.


ENVIRONMENT
       HMMTOP_ARCH
              has  to  point to the file containing the architec-
              ture  of  the  model.   If  not  set,  the  program
              searches  for  the  hmmtop.arch file in the current
              directory.


       HMMTOP_PSV
              has to point to  the  file  containing  the  pseudo
              count  vector  corresponding to the given architec-
              ture. If not set, the program searches for the hmm-
              top.psv file in the current directory.


EXAMPLES
       hmmtop -if=sequence.fas
              predicts  the  topology  of  each  sequence  in the
              sequence.fas file using only single sequence infor-
              mation.  Sequences are in fasta format.

       hmmtop -if=sequence.pir -sf=PIR -pi=mpred
              predicts  the topology of the first sequence in the
              sequence.pir file.  If  there  are  more  than  one
              sequences  in  the sequence.pir file then they will
              be used as helper sequences.

       hmmtop -if=sprot36.dat -sf=SWP
              predicts  the  topology   of   each   sequence   in
              sprot36.dat file, using only single sequence infor-
              mation.  Sequences are  in  swissprot  format  (for
              example the full swissprot database).

       hmmtop -if=sequence.pir -sf=PIR -pi=spred -loc=123-242-I
              predicts the topology of each sequence given in the
              sequence.pir file in pir format with the condition,
              that  the  sequence  piece  between 123 and 242 are
              intracellular.  If sequence.pir file contains  mul-
              tiple  sequences  for each sequence will be handled
              with this condition.

       hmmtop -if=sequence.fas -sf=fas -pi=spred
       -locf=sequence.loc
              predicts the topology of each sequence given in the
              sequence.fas file in fasta format  with  conditions
              given  in  the  sequence.loc  file. The file has to
              contain locates in the syntaxis b-e-sp (see  above)
              for each sequence line by line.
